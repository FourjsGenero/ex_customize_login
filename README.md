An example of customized login boxes

The Genero Desktop Client has the facility to create what is called a "Customized Login Box".  This is so that the first dialog someone sees when logging onto your application has the same look and feel as the rest of your application, rather than being saddled with the standard GDC login dialog.  Not that there is anything wrong with the standard GDC dialog ...

... but you might want to put your company/product name/logo onto the first dialog a user sees, or you might want to use a differnt term than "User name" or you might have a standard of right-align lables, or you might not like the use of ":" delimiter etc.

You can read more about how to create a "Customized Login Box" here https://4js.com/online_documentation/fjs-gdc-manual-html/#gdc-topics/c_gdc_customize_login_box.html At one point we used to ship a sample inside the documentaiton but now the documentaiton says at the end with the sample "This login box is produced by a customized .ui file. You can request a copy of this file from your local support.".  That sample is the example here "login_sample2.ui"
